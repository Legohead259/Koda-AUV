"""
Project 1 program for running the ROV inside a pool.

CONOPS: The ROV will start from one edge of the pool and be placed about two meters away from the wall on its starboard side. The AUV will dive to about one meter and proceed along the width of the pool stopping every meter or so to determine the distance from the wall using the Ping 360 SONAR. This will occur multiple times until the AUV reaches the other side of the pool, where it will ascend and safe itself. Somewhere along the wall, a barrel or similar obstruction will be placed that will cause a noticeable "blip" in the SONAR distance measurements. These measurements will be fed into a Bayesian network to determine the probability of the robot having passed by a barrel or not.

CHANGELOG:
 - Version 1.0.0: Initial release
 - Version 1.1.0: Refactored to clean up code and test new project directory layout
