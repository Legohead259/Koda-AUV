"""
ping360_service.py: This script starts a local server that connects to the Ping360 on the AUV and handles gathering data from it.
This script is intended to run locally on the Raspberry Pi onboard the AUV and access the Ping 360 over a UDP connection.

Client scripts can open a UDP connection to this service's port and the server will command the Ping 360 to begin gathering data along a heading. This service will then filter and parse the data such that the strongest return signal and distance from the AUV is returned to the client. The client may re-connect to the server as many times as desired and receive data.

Note: On start-up there may be a slight delay between client connection and server data sent as the Ping360 SONAR head has to rotated around to the specified bearing. This delay will also be present if different services are trying to work with the Ping 360 such as Ping Viewer. Therefore, it is **not** advised that this service runs consecutively with the Blue Robotics Ping Viewer application.

CHANGELOG:
 - Version 1.0.0: Initial release

TODO:
 - Remove CSV logging features
 - Figure out how to properly filter max intensity accounting for reverb in signal
 - All client to configure certain parameters
    - Angle of scanning
    - Any Ping 360 parameters (e.g. range)
    - If it wants the max intensity+location, min intensity+location, or all intensities+locations
    - Minimum and maximum read distances
 - Add CLI argument parser for Ping 360 Serial (with port) or UDP (with IP address and port)
 -
